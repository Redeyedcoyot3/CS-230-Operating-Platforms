#THE GAMING ROOM

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a client whose requirement was that their gaming application be expanded to various operating systems, like MacOS, Linux, Windows, and Mobile. As a technology consultant for Creative Technology Solutions my job was to explain the integrations of the client's software across multiple platforms and the different architectures available.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I felt that I did particularly well in explaining the differences between the various operating platforms, such as MacOS, Linux, Windows, and mobile as they applied to software development and applications. By identifying particular aspects of each platform like the different file system components, the multiple functions of memory and storage manageent, memory management techniques, and the distributed systems and networks that accompany them. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document acted as an outline for the code utilized because as the application was being different components also had to be analyzed so that they can be incorporated into the template. The Gaming Room UML diagram was also helpful in adding value to the design template, because it was a rubric for the structure of the gaming application which helped in explaining the methodology.  

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Looking back at the design document I would revise the requirements and system architecture view section, and would rewrite them so that more detail was provided into what the requirements actually are, and the design constraints as well. I think more emphasis could have been provided into what the differences between constraints would be between a traditional platform and cloud-based platform would be.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When considering the users needs it's important to understand exactly what they are asking and then getting as close as possible to that requirement. In terms of instantiating a game class that allows multiple players in different instances of the game to be running simultaneously I think this follows the user's needs and requirements. Not all aspects are going to be incorporated into a user's requirements for an application but it's important to consider the one's that are most integral.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
It first tooks me some time to figure out how an API actually worked, especially through Maven using the Java programming language. Then I had to learn how to instantiate a class object that used the Get and path function. Building each of the objects in each class took a lot of trial and error but overall was able to get the program to run efficientaly based on the particular plugin in Maven. Following the resources also helped as a baseline when using the DropWizard as well. In the future, I would ensure that I would have experience in utilizing API in my programs so I have more practice with them, because this was the first time doing so.
